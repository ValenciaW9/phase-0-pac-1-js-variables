//To declare the variable, we use either the let or const reserved word. (And, in fact, there's a third option as well: var.  for now know  that when you see const, let or var those are reserved words which are used to declare a variable.
let pi;
// => undefined

//the javascript engine sets aside a chunck of memory to store the declared variavke.  Then we assign a value to that variable using the assignment expression:
pi = 3.1459;
//=> 3.1459

//We can majke our code a bit more efficient by oackaging both initaliztion steps - declaration and assignment --in a single line of code:
let pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined
